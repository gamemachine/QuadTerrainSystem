# QuadTerrainSystem

Quad tree based chunk rendering using bursted jobs and native containers.  Fairly straight forward and similar to what you find in most engines/AAA games.  Includes a set of patch meshes.   Includes a simple DrawMeshInstanced rendering setup.  No terrain specific shading, heightmaps, etc..
