# QuadTerrainSystem

Quad tree based chunk rendering.  Fairly straight forward and similar to what you find in most engines/AAA games.  Includes a set of patch meshes.  Depends on Burst but not ECS.  Includes a simple DrawMeshInstanced rendering setup.  No terrain specific shading, heightmaps, etc..
