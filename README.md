# QuadTerrainSystem

Quad tree based chunk rendering using bursted jobs and native containers.  Fairly straight forward and similar to what you find in most engines/AAA games.  Sorts out which cells are in the camera frustum and which patch mesh to use at what scale.  Includes a set of patch meshes.

A simple DrawMeshInstanced rendering setup is included.  No terrain specific shading, heightmaps, etc..
